            <p className="about-text">I went to university at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, now known as Ontario Tech. I pursued Mechatronics engineering because it encapsulated multiple disciplines of engineering in one program. This includes: mechanical, electrical, computer and software engineering. All the makings of robotics.</p>
            <p className="about-text">During my time in school, a lot of my skills grew in the field of software primarily rather than a jack of all trades. This was mainly because of my exposure to ROS which largely consists of programming in C++ and Python using simulators, which made it possible to work on projects without requiring physical prototypes. In addition to my undergraduate research project, I took on an internship where all my work consisted of programming the prototype in Python and creating an Android application in Java to control the robot remotely.</p>
            <p className="about-text">As time went on, my roles in group projects became more programming oriented rather than design or assembly. This increased my interest in programming concepts and languages, to the point where I decided to learn Web Development. This started with learning a bit of Django, a bit of React, until I decided to take a complete Web Development Bootcamp through Udemy. Learning everything from HTML, CSS and JS, all the way to React, Web3 and blockchain development. All of these courses have shown me just a glimpse of what is out there to pursue, and it all sounds so fascinating!</p>
            <p className="about-text">As time goes on, I hope to showcase all the various projects I create in the future through this portfolio website. Whether that be web development projectsor mechatronics projects. Stay tuned!</p>
