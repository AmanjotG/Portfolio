            "Working in a team to design and develop a Multi-Agent SLAM workflow for mapping unknown environments in RVIZ using ROS-python and the Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) library.",
            "Tasked with using software to obtain information from vision sensors to create 3D renders of environments using a Kinect 360 camera module. The crawler could generate multiple maps of the environment with a common reference point which would allow for the stitching of several maps into one complete map.",
            "Aided in design of physical prototype and testing as well as measuring performance of mapping software by comparing overall coverage to test environment."

            "Working on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for autonomous robot platform in ROS. This required ability to localise within environment using GPS and LiDAR, and the ability to navigate to waypoints without overshooting.",
            "Developing Android application in Java for teleoperation of robots. Application included: a joystick to drive the robot, a Google map fragment to display GPS position and ability to begin/stop/pause autonomous navigation.",
            "Training and development of object recognition machine learning algorithms. This required data collection of images from vineyards and orchards to train the model to detect grapes and apples. The model was then used to give yield estimation of the fruits which was shown in a heat map of the location; showing where most of the fruits were being grown."
